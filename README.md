# Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Journal in Vue

Thanks for checking out this app. This is a personal project to help me keep track of my training and to also work on my developer skills. This repo is specifically for the app that's built with Vue 3 and Vite. I have another repo with the same kind of app built w/ React. Both will be in constant production and may never be fully "live".

## Local Setup

1. Ensure you have the latest Node/NPM installed
2. Download the repo and save anywhere on your machine
3. `cd` into the root level of the project
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `npm run dev` - This will run the build tool, Vite
6. The output should show the url to go to (usually http://localhost:5173/)
